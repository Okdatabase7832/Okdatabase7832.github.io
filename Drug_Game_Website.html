		<h1 align="center">Grabbing the Students Attention</h1>
		<p align="center">We would like to incorporate the drug game board with the existing health curriculum.</p>
		<h3>The teacher's scenario:</h3>
		<p>A student was discharged from the hospital, after being brought there the day before by ambulance. The student was treated for an overdoes of an opioid.</p>
		<p>The class will be divided into three groups: Friends, Parents, The community.</p>
		<p>Questions will then be aksed of each group as the class travels around the board. The teacher will encourage the open discussion of the impact of drug use on each group. This engagement may help the students discover new ways of seeing familiar things.</p>
		<h3>Questions:</h3>
		<p>Define friend, will your homies fit that definition, Who might?</p>
		<p>What do you think caused your friends to change who they were, to do someting they knew would hurt them?</p>
		<p>How do you see the Police, Friend or foe?</p>
		<p>Has there been anything missing from your property or the neighbors?</p>
		<p>What good might come out of going to jail?</p>
		<p>What is an abandominium, or stash house?</p>
		<p>What is a fix, is someting broken-WHAT?</p>
		<p>What are your plans for the future?</p>
		<p>The students will learn some lasting consequences to drug use.</p>
